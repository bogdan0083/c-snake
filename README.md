## Disclaimer
> The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to make a very simple game in C that works on all platforms. Please note that I'm not very proficient with C. The source code and overall architecture of the game can be improved in lots of ways. I would be happy to receive Pull Requests if you feel like something needs to be changed/improved.
